    <i>Rainy:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    So for Disk 1 I decided to write a character select theme in the vain of Street Fighter 2. I thought it would be a perfect fit for the art [[artist:kiddlescribbles|Kiddles]] made (which is really good btw).

    So i asked [[artist:tee-vee|Tee-Vee]] cover my remix of [[track:MeGaLoVania]] as a bonus song for this album because i originally wanted it to be played live for BefoprusBound but we ran out of time so i left my original guitars in there. He did an amazing job though, like i didn't think that solo at the end was playable to be honest but whaddaya know, it sounds fucking epic lmao. Now i just gotta get him to play the DX version...
