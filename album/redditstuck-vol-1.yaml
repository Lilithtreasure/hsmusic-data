    <i>Nicholas Nakano:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 7/14/2016)

    That's some nice tunes. What sound font is it, or how did you make it?

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 7/15/2016)

    fami module, 2a03 classical

    <i>olkiswerve:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 9/24/2016)

    what a cool and new song

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 9/25/2016)

    you're really making me wish canwc never used this

    <i>Minish:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 10/7/2016)

    olki's actually a team member, its just a joke

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 10/7/2016)

    jokes are great

    <i>Mathias Ramalho:</i> ([SoundCloud comments](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 2/11/2017)

    I thought this was made by the [[group:canmt|Cool and New Music Team]].<br>
    Did you based your track on it?

    <i>Emelia K.:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/emelia-kaylee/conflict), 2/12/2017)

    i made this, this was made for redditstuck, it was used in redditstuck, and the canwc people spun it off into their own abhorrent joke of largely their own accord
