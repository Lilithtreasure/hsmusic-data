    Details from foreverFlummoxed regarding [[tag:sev-reddistuck]], perhaps:

    > the top right might be Sev because his Uncle (only been mentioned, no physical appearance yet) has a bike, i believe, but i left it untagged for now since there's to know for sure as of now

    <i>Redditstuck:</i> ([Bandcamp description](https://redditstuckmusic.bandcamp.com/track/unreal-city))

    Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br>
    When I count, there are only you and I together<br>
    But when I look ahead up the white road<br>
    There is always another one walking beside you<br>
    Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded<br>
    I do not know whether a man or a woman<br>
    â€”But who is that on the other side of you?
