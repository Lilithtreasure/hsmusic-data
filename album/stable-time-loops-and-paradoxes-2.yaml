    This song was basically made out of my love for the Alpha kids planets, this one in particular was supposed to be a kinda chill theme for the Land of Tombs and Krypton. The version you hear on the album took several hours as I was very critical and indecisive about what I was writing. In the end I'm proud of what's here but one day I'd like to revisit the song and hopefully fix the parts I was super unsure about.

    This was initially going to be a recreation, utilizing the Secret of Mana soundfont used in the original song. I decided to try out some of the same instruments used in [[track:stronger-monsters]] (from Undertale) as well, which at that point I thought "what the heck, let's just make a full-on remix of this". Fun fact: I was initially following along [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|PotatoBoss']] [Versus recreation video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYfZBrReslY), before I knew who he was.

    I made this song as a birthday gift to [[artist:rowyn-berlan]], i wanted to kind of parody [[album:the-baby-is-you|"The Baby is You"]] since we had just finished ["The Baby is STLaP2"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqi0iMdsva_wMBDC1dZgYmg--sJgtXtmG) and it seemed funny to me to make that for them. The only song I referenced was [[track:miasmic-decay|"Miasmic Decay"]] because Rowyn made it and that would make the song still fit in the album because it's still a remix of a song in the album. Also DVS-Saxophone is the best instrument, change my mind.

    This [[track:crystalanthemums|Crystal]] remix is actually my first attempt at a song with entirely digital-sounding instruments (I.e. saws, squares, DVS sax and the like) but it survived the dreadful soundtest so..

    Anyway, it’s mostly a Crystal remix simply because nearly every time I make something I can feel this song trying to inch it’s way in there, so I scratched that itch and gave it it’s own song to try to hold it back.

    It didn’t work.

    I wanted to make a beatdown remix that was kind of beach-y i suppose? So basically i took [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]], some upbeat drums, Earthbound beach sounds, \*DVS SAX\* and some other cool stuff. I ended up with a pretty cool result, it was basically exactly what i wanted. Near the end i also sampled the original Beatdown for a cool effect, and also at the end because i wanted to make it sound as if you were sitting on the beach, listening to Beatdown through a small radio. The Vriska references where just kinda there because they sound good with the rest, they are in squarewave to match Dave’s intrumentation. And lastly the name is also obviously a reference to Beatdown.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Caelan Kier:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    I listen to a lot of prog-metal-that’s-also-very-melodic, a good example is Sithu Aye, who is the main inspiration behind this song, I love the way he keeps this melodic flow throughout pretty much every song and has like every other instrument that’s not the lead dedicated to just backing up this melody; So I thought it would be a good idea to turn this style into chiptune. It’s different than my usual chiptune style, and I guess that just kinda developed as I made the song, but honestly I like the way this sounds more than my normal style so I’ll probably make more songs like this. I wanna say more but that’s p much it lol.

    This song is a redone version of an old Lo-Fi Hip-Hop remix i made of the song [[track:moonsetter|“Moonsetter”]] by Toby Fox. I didn’t like the old one i made but since i was getting so much positive feedback on it i decided to remake it for this album. It turned out way better than the old version in my opinion and i hope everyone who listened to the old version agrees with me.

    <i>apatheticPianist:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    Tbh this’s one of my fav songs I’ve ever made? For a few reasons, one being that admittedly it was made in GarageBand and yet isn’t (totally) awful-sounding instrument-wise, and another being that swapping the “main” instruments of Dave’s and John’s motifs worked out really well, imo, and finally cuz it’s from a transitional period right before I got better software and so sort of marks a personal turning point on the path towards becoming a better composer? It’s a pretty nice jam, regardless of all that, and [[track:spacetime-continuum|I might wind up doing]] either a remaster of it or a version with Jade and Rose for STLaP3 - hope y’all enjoy listening!

    <i>Caelan Kier:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)
    
    So this was made back when [[album:alternate-hues-and-melodies|AHaM]] was being made, pretty close to it being released the guy who was making the Sollux song didn't finish it for reasons I can't be bothered remembering, and since the position for the Sollux song was open I was like "damn I wanna do the Sollux song because Sollux is cool". So I made the first melody you hear in [[Distortion Navigator]], but before I could do anymore we had to release the album like right then and there, so I didn't get to finish it. Then I just turned it into the full Sollux song I wanted back then and released it here on STLaP 2 instead.

    I remember like thinking that [my Mutiny remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3znbbnDOChY) could be totally better, so like I only made this a while after that was uploaded (that's why it sounds so much like my old stuff). I didn't even plan for the song to be said remix, I was just bored in FL Studio and placed down the [[track:mutiny|Mutiny]] melody in there and somehow just kept going until it turned into a full song. I was gonna put it in [[album:stable-time-loops-and-paradoxes|STLaP 1]], but then didn't because [[track:fetch-the-bullet|there was already a Mutiny remix]], so first chance I got I dunked it into STLaP 2.

    A while ago, i worked on an album called [[album:solar-sessions|“Solar Sessions”]] hosted by “Handshake Collaborations”. On this is a song called [[track:earth-solar-sessions|“Earth”]] by psithurist. I was extremely inspired by this song because it’s so good, so i tried to make something in that style. The way it came out, it was pretty perfect for a chill Derse kinda song so i ended up putting it on STLaP 2.

    Now [[track:candles-and-clockwork|Candles and Clockwork]] over the years has become my favorite song from Homestuck so of course I wanted to try and do something with it. Candlelit originally started out as [[track:candlelit-contemplation-beta|a shitty PXTone cover]] that’s on my YouTube Channel (you’ve been warned) and well after a while I grew unhappy with it. One day I got the stupid idea to reverse the song and boy am I glad I did that. I decided to try and make a remix of Candles and Clockwork that would sound just as good reversed and well what’s there sure is something. (By the way all the reversed bits are actually from the original PXTone version which I thought was a cool little reference)

    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    So this one is pretty odd (obviously wtf). One day i was hanging out on the Bowman Discord server and we were just kinda talking, so then Michael mentions that him and some friends are making a Strider version of the vocals to [[track:cory-in-the-house-theme-song|the Cory in the House opening]], and i was like, ohshit i can make a remix of the theme that uses Strider motifs if you want :eyes:. So i made it and i named the instrumental version CITH Beatdown as a reference to [[track:wsw-beatdown|WSW Beatdown]]. Later the vocals were added and it became Strider in the House. Thanks for making this Michael your Dave voice is epic lmao.

    <i>Michael Parker:</i> (Dave, booklet commentary)

    This entire concept started as a joke between me and my friends, “what if you took Dave Strider and put him in Cory in the House”. It was a meme, a dumb idea I did and even drew art for. We came up with a whole scenario and description of “the show”. Then we were like “what if we made a parody of an intro”, and I contacted PotatoBoss and proposed the concept. I was honestly shocked when he agreed to make an instrumental remix of Cory in the House. Over the span of around a month or two, we made the music, got myself and my friend to record the lyrics, and then made it a video on youtube. Now it’s making an appearance on this album, which boggles my mind. I voice Dave Strider, while my friend Bun sings as Vriska. Making this was extremely fun, since I have no musical talent whatsoever, but enjoy working with PMT on their various projects. Everyone in PMT is so talented, and as cheesy as it sounds, it’s an honor to be able to contribute to this album and work with them. To be honest, this shitpost is probably my magnum opus, but I am perfectly fine with that.

    <i>The Pure Spectre:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)

    So, this song apparently started way back in 2017, where it was just a mere shadow of it’s current self. Simply put, it was the main beginning bit, ‘cept it was at a slower tempo, and sounded decently worse than it does now. I had it lying around when I joined the PMT, and decided it has potential. So, I took it, looked closely at how [[Black]] actually played, and made it into a more fully-fledged remix. Can I say it’s my best work? Probably not. But I would, at the very least, hope that it’s decently enjoyable to listen to if anything. Funnily enough, when I uploaded the song to SoundCloud (where it suffered in quality from the upload, unfortunately) I mentioned in the description that it was likely to be my last Homestuck song/remix. Apparently, I was lying to everyone including myself, since I not only made another song for the STLaP2 album, but I’ve got a larger project in the works... a project being made in the most unorthodox ways, but being created nonetheless.

    This song has a special place in my heart because it my first homestuck remix. I started this song months before I joined the PMT and I remember doing it out of boredom. I wanted to make remix a song the no one had done before, so I decided to remix the first half of the unreleased song [[track:jadesprite|"Jadesprite."]] The [[track:spritely-gardener-beta|original demo]] of the song was like 30 seconds long and wasn't very good imo. Joining the team gave me the impetus I needed to expand upon my original demo and finish the song. Of my remixes, this one is probably my favorite.

    One day i was just listening to [[track:davesprite|“Davesprite”]] by Toby Fox and i was trying to recreate the opening drums. Since i always wanted to remix Davesprite i decided to just lay down the main melody too and remix the song. This song probably took longest to make, not because it was harder than the rest, but because it kept being edited. The first time was because i messed up some notes and pitching, the i removed some parts for no reason which i ended up adding back later. Then i got some disc scratch samples from [[artist:erik-scheele|Erik Scheele]] that sounded really cool so i added those in, that took a while to get decent too. And still with this version i’m not 100% satisfied but it’ll do. And the name is “Davesprite 3” because there’s an unused song by Erik Scheele called [[track:davesprite2|“Davesprite 2”]] so i just followed up after that.

    This track was actually a commission for a fantroll theme. I basically just based the entire song off one motif that i used from Lust, the rest of the song was based off the track [[track:virgin-orb|“Virgin Orb”]] by Toby Fox. I promised 2 commissioners that i would use their fantroll themes in STLaP 2 and [[track:i-warned-you-about-the-elevator-bro|i did]]. I’m kinda glad i did too because i really like the songs.

So in short this remix really breathes new life into [[track:black|Black]] and as a whole adds enough to the base composition to make something unique. Also Spad3s, buddy, you gotta get over your Black addiction.

    [[artist:rowyn-berlan]] and i were once in a fansession, there she made a song titled: “Deception” which she still hates with a flaming passion, even though i don’t think it’s that bad, around the time that she made that i tried to remix it into a sort of really fast battle theme based on [[Umbral Ultimatum]] by Toby Fox. At first this song sounded really different because i had used sounds from games like Goemon on Nintendo 64 and Earthbound, then i tried to use more orchestral sounds and it just sounded way better. So in the end i think it came out really well for what it is, \*Umbral Ultimatum 2\* B)

    I had the idea for for a jazzy version of [[track:cascade-beta|“Cascade”]] for a while. As I started making however, it slowly but surly turned into a remix of [[track:flare-cascade-cut|“Flare (Cascade Cut).”]] I also added a little bit of [[track:liquid-negrocity|“Liquid Negrocity”]] for added jazziness. I’m pretty sure that this song sucks at being jazz but is pretty alright in being a song.

    This song's commentary is going to get a little serious. After doing [[track:spritely-gardener]], I wanted to do another song for the album. I had a bunch of stuff started but I just never had the energy to finish them. One of the ideas was a massive multi movement homestuck medley referencing all the beta kids' land theme. But like the other WIPs, I couldn't bring myself to work on it more. This went on until some time in early November. In November, I learned that [[artist:buzinkai|[Usagi] Buzinkai]], Creator of homestuck songs like [[track:doctor|"Doctor"]] and [[track:endless-climb|"Endless Climb"]], had passed away. I was felt a profound sense of grief at her death. Some time passed, and I wanted to do something to commemorate her memory. So I decided to give my old project file another shot and that how "A Happy Ending" was created. I wanted to create something that embodied how much Homestuck and it's musicians meant to me. Is it perfect? No, it has a lot of issues and is overly long (Sorry [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Pb]]). But I think it is something conveys the monumental impact that homestuck had on my life.
