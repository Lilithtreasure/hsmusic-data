Lyrics: |-
    We wake to lights that blind
    Memories all left behind
    But we've no room to play pretend
    We know the story in the end

    We've been living a life in combat, broken glass beneath our feet
    Hoping each day might be the comeback, for hearts left incomplete
    But talking with your fists won't last a lifetime, your bones'll break someday
    And everybody needs to have a lifeline, when they've been led astray

    'Cause when I ride with you, I feel my love renewed
    Our hearts in stereo under the streetlight glow
    And when we fly by night, it sets my soul alight
    So take what's left unused, made into something new

    So in the midnight haze
    We watch the hours turn to days
    When sunlight falls and dark descends
    Together, meet our bitter end

    We've been living a lie so long that the things replaced we almost lost
    Never had a truth on which to fall back, we just ran at any cost
    But baby when you hide from all the sightlines, all you'll do is fade away
    So if you need a lodestar, watch the moonlight, your guide in shining Grey

    'Cause when I ride with you, I feel my love renewed
    Our hearts in stereo under the streetlight glow
    And when we fly by night, it all just feels so right
    I give my love anew, my beating heart for you

    We've been living a life in combat, heart repressed to make it through
    Hoping each day might be the comeback, to find some link from me to you
    But we don't have to live our life in retreat, always running from our fate
    I know that you can feel our mirrored heartbeats, we can let the music play

    'Cause when I ride with you, I feel my love renewed
    Our hearts in stereo under the streetlight glow
    And when we fly by night, it sets my soul alight
    So take what's left unused, made into something new
