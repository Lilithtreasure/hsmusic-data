    I think of this as Pala's theme song. Nostalgic and summery the way her design and story always felt to me.

Lyrics: |-
    It's always summer, always summer
    Always summer by the sea
    Waiting for change like I'm in
    Someone else's story

    We're in a summer, in a summer
    In a summer fantasy
    Come float away with me

    It's always summer, always summer
    Always summer by the sea
    Waiting for change like I'm in
    Someone else's story

    We're in a summer, in a summer
    In a summer fantasy
    Come float away with me

    It's always summer, always summer
    Always summer by the sea
    Waiting for change like I'm in
    Someone else's story

    We're in a summer, in a summer
    In a summer fantasy
    Come float away with me

    It's always summer (always summer)
    Always summer (by the sea)
    Waiting for change (like I'm in)
    Someone else's story

    We're in a summer (in a summer)
    In a summer (fantasy)
    Come float away with me
