    one other really hard thing to hear is this sample of an amen break i added for no reason

    ([[media:misc/breaks_imagine_a_funny_smiley_face_here.wav|breaks_imagine_a_funny_smiley_face_here.wav]])

    the amen breaks just get drowned by all the really loud guitars and other stuff

    This one has an additional part, with references to many Homestuck tracks.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Regarding the reference to [[The Blind Prophet]], which is really a reference to its adaptation (1:23â€“1:28) of [[Courser]]:

    alright so theres this piano counter melody thingy at the last guitar part, it's very hard to hear but i think that last melody thingy is in the blind prophet version only

    heres a render with only the guitars and piano from that moment

    ([[media:misc/ultimate_guitar_kit_my_beloved.wav|ultimate_guitar_kit_my_beloved.wav]])

    the extended one is mostly the same as the main one, just with an additional guitar part

    i think i sort of understand toby a little (nothing ever sounds right)
