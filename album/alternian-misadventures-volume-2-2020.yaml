    <i>Xszelor:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://dvojka.bandcamp.com/album/alternian-misadventures-volume-2-2020))
    Album i made long ago, for some things we never finished, but tried a lot.

    I never re-mastered tracks till this day, and they were buried deep in my old music archives. Only some tracks been remade for [[album:riddle-of-dixy-path-of-mind-ost|RoD:PoM OST]].

    <i>Jebb:</i> (wiki editor)
    Despite the album being added to Bandcamp on May 24th 2024, the tracks were actually released much earlier than that on VK, with the date on the Bandcamp release stating that the album was made on October 23, 2020.
