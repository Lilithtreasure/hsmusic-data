    <i>Redditstuck:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://redditstuckmusic.bandcamp.com/album/redditstuck-vol-2))

    The company is still following our every move, demanding cash tributes of inordinate sums. Keep rejecting their demands and maybe one day we'll actually be able to sell one of these for a reasonable price.

    This track is included as a bonus in the Bandcamp download, though in this placement on the track list - it's just hidden from the main view online.

    <i>Redditstuck, Unknown Artist|[[artist:unknown-artist|????????]]:</i>

    Teeth. They crawl over my body, gums bleeding dark ichor as they brush my skin. A thousand thousand swollen ticks find purchase in flesh as pus pulses through every orifice. Laughing. I see shadows now and then that make my heart skip, that make me wonder “Is someone finally here to take me away?” But I’m wrong every time. Inventing ghosts to keep my mind sane. Whispering to myself.

    "(I Can't Get No) Smooth Pencils"
