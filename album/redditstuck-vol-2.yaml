    <i>Redditstuck:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://redditstuckmusic.bandcamp.com/album/redditstuck-vol-2))

    The company is still following our every move, demanding cash tributes of inordinate sums. Keep rejecting their demands and maybe one day we'll actually be able to sell one of these for a reasonable price.

  Notes: |-
    Details from foreverFlummoxed regarding the lack of location tag:

    > Altair is a SBURB construct, so it is a player's land but it's not clear what land it is (may not even be revealed yet) which is why i left it blank
    >
    > i think there's a few other examples of locations without tags, and that mainly why for them

    This track is included as a bonus in the Bandcamp download, though in this placement on the track list - it's just hidden from the main view online.

    <i>Gordian:</i> ([SoundCloud description](https://soundcloud.com/realbillwatterson/gnade), 9/30/2016)

    Written as an Eve theme, but when it came time to make the title, I realized it would work as a third installment to the Ruhe series (no it's still not done. Wait and see)

    <i>Gordian:</i> ([SoundCloud tags](https://soundcloud.com/realbillwatterson/gnade), 9/30/2016)

    for volume 2: are the arts for Gnade and [[Frieden]] supposed to be anything/some location? (besides Skaia in the bg of Gnade)

    I don't remember whose idea it was to make this art purple (it may have been mine) but the version on my Soundcloud is the original and is unrelated to Redditstuck. So you can consider it as canon as you like fwiw

Commentary: |-
    <i>Redditstuck, Unknown Artist|[[artist:unknown-artist|????????]]:</i>

    Teeth. They crawl over my body, gums bleeding dark ichor as they brush my skin. A thousand thousand swollen ticks find purchase in flesh as pus pulses through every orifice. Laughing. I see shadows now and then that make my heart skip, that make me wonder “Is someone finally here to take me away?” But I’m wrong every time. Inventing ghosts to keep my mind sane. Whispering to myself.
