    Hey y'all, i was commissioned to make this song for an MSPAF called Crud Spade recently. This song was for the character Mayonaka who is the secretive head of the midnight crew, even if they don't know it. If you want to read Crud Spade (and i highly recommend you do its very good) you can read it here: https://mspfa.com/?s=29375&p=1 If you're looking for an original song for your own comic or characters and need someone to make one, or you just want a silly remix, you should consider also commissioning me here: http://potatoboss.net/
