    A collection of all my finished chiptune covers from 2016, sorted in chronological order. Most of them are on my YouTube but there's some that I never released because I didn't feel they were worth publishing there.

    Track 9 has minor changes from its upload on YouTube.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (9/7/2017 edit)
    Bandcamp now only has covers from Homestuck and related fanworks; other ones I made at that time are bonus tracks.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (1/27/2019 edit)
    Renamed the album again. Futurama 8-bit cover is no longer a bonus track but the rest still are.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> (5/28/2021 edit)
    No more bonus tracks, everything on the album is publicly visible again without needing to download the album.

    <i>Jebb:</i> (Wiki editor)
    All of the track art for this album has been taken from the YouTube uploads of the tracks.

    Here's an 8-bit remix of a Homestuck song. Unlike my previous 8-bit covers, this one was made using Famitracker, which many consider to be a more legitimate way to make 8-bit music than stuff like GXSCC.

    Happy 4/13 everybody! Here's another 8-bit cover, this time of a much under-appreciated song judging by its results on YouTube. I mean seriously, it's essentially the sequel to one of the comic's most memorable songs.

    <i>cookiefonster:</i> ([YouTube commentary edit](https://youtu.be/1J9EhfZGroU))
    I've remade this cover five years after the initial upload. Link to the new version: [youtu.be/1Ym2UGBJ02Q](https://youtu.be/1Ym2UGBJ02Q)

    An 8-bit cover of Oppa Toby Style, one of the four songs used in the Homestuck animation [S] Collide, made using Famitracker. I'm very proud of this one, even looking back a year and a half later, and I'm happy it got as popular as it did.

    If you didn't know, Mutiny is a removed Homestuck song made by Bill Bolin, who quit the music team after songs of his were used without permission. Even though it was removed it's still easy to find online and it's a nice song regardless.

    This isn't actually a new 8 bit cover. I made this almost a year ago and already released it on my Bandcamp, but never uploaded it to YouTube for some reason even though I'm quite happy with this cover. So here you go.

    If there's one thing about Homestuck everyone can agree on, it's that it has amazing music. Among the songs used in flashes, this was always easily one of my favorites—same goes for the flash itself, [S] Jade: Enter.

    The full 5-minute version of the Futurama theme song which you can find on YouTube, in 8-bit form. I'm incredibly proud of this 8-bit cover; it almost sounds like real video game title screen music!

    I'm also really happy that the show itself has an 8-bit rendition of itself so I don't have to make more shitty MS Paint art.

    An 8-bit cover of a song from [[album:cool-and-new-voulem1|Cool and New Webcomic Volume 1]], a satirical music album by fans of Homestuck with some legitimately good songs; this song is one of them. I am contributing to the second album, which as of the publication of this video will be released in five days.

    If you didn't know, Psychedelic Psychodelic is a song from [[album:lofam2|Land of Fans and Music 2]], a Homestuck fan album with a lot of awesome songs. This one is one of my favorites from that album. Also it has bits of some other songs I've covered ([[track:lets-all-rock-the-heist|Let's All Rock the Heist]] and [[track:walk-stab-walk-r-and-e|Walk-Stab-Walk]]) which is pretty cool.

    I accidentally made the thumbnail for this video look like a death metal album, ah well. This is still one of the best covers I've done in my opinion. It even has slightly less audio artifacts than usual!

    Behold my YouTube channel’s first Christmas special, unquestionably my magnum opus—or at least, it was at the time.

    As you can probably tell by now, I’ve lately become unbearably addicted to Snow Halation. That song goes incredibly well with everything, and let’s face it: it’s catchy as all fuck. So it’s only worth trying to do this song justice with Famitracker.

    You’d think chiptune covers of Snow Halation would’ve been done to death by now, which is in a way true. But I feel that any other covers I could find on YouTube at the time were missing something, and I’m not even saying this ironically. All those covers either lacked drums, had all instruments the same for some reason, were blatantly plugged into GXSCC (snore!), or weren’t the whole thing. This cover reaches some seriously uncharted depths, people. You better appreciate that.

    Merry Christmas everyone.

    This cover which I released on my Bandcamp a week ago isn't good enough for my main channel but I still wanted to put it on YouTube because unlike practically all other songs from this game this one hasn't been chiptune covered to death already, which I find pretty mind blowing.
