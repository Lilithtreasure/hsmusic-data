    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://bowman.bandcamp.com/album/archive))

    Commissions, novelty tracks, experiments in electronica from 2012-2016. Download features 10 bonus tracks.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Thanks to a copyright claim on the stock cloud photo in its album cover, [[album:archive|the original Archive release]] was taken down in July 2018. After workshopping a new cover made from original assets, Bowman worked with [[artist:hadron]] to create the final artwork for this September 2018 re-release.

    The track list was also shuffled around, with ten taken from the main list and made into bonus tracks, [[track:awake-archive]] renamed as [[track:awake-2013-version]], [[track:crimesters-credits]] renamed as [[track:emerys-theme]], and [[track:crimesters-theme]] renamed as [[track:emerys-theme-fast-version]].

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (Bowmantown Discord, excerpts, 9/4/2018)

    I've been playing with some ideas for a new version of the cover, I wanted to see what you thought.

    Here's a really rough one I put together a few days ago:

    Unfinished "Archive" 2nd edition cover.

    <img src="media/misc/archive-2018-wip.jpg" width="300">

    > oh wow that’s really cool too<br>
    > that could be pretty sick<br>
    > although I don’t know how well it fits the calmer songs like awake

    Interesting, is the EYE too abrasive?

    I've considered versions with an all-seeing Illuminati-esque eye on the screen.

    What do you think of using a laptop

    It's the actual one I used until 2012 so it has special significance.

    It's been shopped a little to make it more symmetrical, just like the old picture.

    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (Bowmantown Discord, excerpts, 9/24/2018)

    [[artist:hadron|@Hadronus]] did great work on the new art and gave me way more than I expected from the new computer he rendered

    The hand was his idea<br>
    The clouds are not mine but are purchased with a royalty-free license<br>
    I added the same gradient map as before

    It should be on Spotify soon and I’ll make a new “best of” playlist

    This has been hanging over me for a while so I’m glad to get this done
