Lyrics: |-
    Home, in this game we play<br>Stunned, then whisked away<br>Staring out into a nightmare
    Stuck years in the past<br>I stepped through the looking glass<br>And descended to an empty world.
    Breaking through from the ground<br>Is there still hope<br>Waiting here to be freed<br>Can this world be restored, will it rise up<br>If I planted the seeds<br>Could I bring it back to life?
    Those that died, they left behind<br>Cryptic writings to explain<Br>Four heroes once were promised<br>Too late, these tablets and fossils<br>All that remains
    Breaking through from the ground<br>Is there still hope<br>Waiting here to be freed<br>Can this world be restored, will it rise up<br>If I planted the seeds<br>Could I bring it back to life?
    We will flood the sky<br>With unearthly light<br>But if every lantern dies<br>Do we all fall down?
    Just a wish to sow<br>So I carved our hope<br>Filled it up<br>Then let it go
    In a world lighter than air<br>Could a dream that's lost be healed?<br>The hope I held beside me<br>Took flight as I entered this wasteland<br>Daylight revealed
    Buried under the ground<br>Is there no hope<br>Waiting here to be freed?<br>Like this world we'll be dead<br>Will we rise up<br>If I planted the seeds...
    When I fall back to sleep and I'm dreaming<br>I'll look up to the clouds<br>If it's out there to see, to believe in<br>There's no reason to doubt
    Step out into the world<br>We're not homestuck<br>Take the chance to be free<br>'Cause this land can't be dead<br>We will rise up<br>So I planted the seeds<br>And I'll bring it back to life.

Lyrics: |-
    (Luck can be defined as probability taken personally, and is often described as one's belief in an intangible force, that is able to indirectly enact change in one's environment. The more favorable to one the change is, the luckier one is said to be. In contrast, strength can be defined as the measure of one's ability to directly enact change in one's environment. Therefore, though they approach it differently, luck and strength share a common purpose.)

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MNfr-CC56E))

    As evident by the title, this is intended to be a style parody of Blue Man Group, using the themes of Vriska and Equius as a base. Iâ€™ve always wanted to write a song using the PVC pipe instrument, and this seemed like a good opportunity.

    <i>Malcolm Brown:</i>
    Couldn't end my run on Homestuck without doing one last John/Showtime track! It's an orchestral smorgasbord of Ballad of Awakening, Lifdoff, Showtime and probably something else I've forgotten. Also makes use of Shepard Tones in the middle to give the impression of a constantly rising melody, (or just to sound annoying)
    Didn't quite make the Volume 10 cut, but presented here for your enjoyment! :D

Lyrics: |-
    I'm still wondering,<br>Where to go now,<br>We have seen the highest peak but there was nothing there, no truth, and how<br>I'm wandering,<br>Through all these places,<br>Lands of Little Cubes & Tea, of Wind and Shade, these null spaces.
    I've stared at the stars, how they shine verdant dreams,<br>I've looked through the void, seen it crack at the seams,<br>I fought every challenge, these Devils and Gods,<br>They won't know what hit them!
    ([S]ynchronize) With every BREATH resounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) We'll see the LIGHT astounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) TIME keeps our heartbeat pounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) Now witness SPACE surrounding!
    I'm still wandering,<br>In this Cascade,<br>See this Universe we made, will you remem8er me?<br>These games we played?<br>Our plundering;<br>Boonbucks and Grist,<br>Prospit and Derse,<br>In the end we gave them everything, our final verse.
    I've sang with the muses, dead timelines denied,<br>I've hunted the wolf and seen planets Collide,<br>I've witnessed the end of these Gods and their Tiers,<br>And no one could save them...
    ([S]ynchronize) See this new LIFE we're founding,<br>([S]ynchronize) Now with the VOID confounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) It's all our HEARTs still sounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) Infinite HOPE abounding!
    Showtime!
    [Instrumental]
    [Bridge: Her Imperilous Constatation]
    ([S]ynchronize) With every BREATH resounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) We'll see the LIGHT astounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) TIME keeps our heartbeat pounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) Now witness SPACE surrounding!
    ([S]ynchronize) With every BREATH resounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) We'll see the LIGHT astounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) TIME keeps our heartbeat pounding,<br>([S]ynchronize) Now witness SPACE surrounding!
    This will be the end!<br>Come with me and we'll Ascend!<br>Solving puzzles Universal,<br>In our Sburban Reversal!<br>All these Ruins we Explore,<br>Could it be there's something more?<br>Pester me, I'm not alone,<br>I'm just Stuck inside my Home!

    This one goes back a long ways. I wrote the first version of Bane back in 2001, originally envisioned as a final boss fight. I really liked the theme, so I made different versions of it over the years, although [[track:bane-old|the last version]] I did was about 13 years ago in 2005. Several times I considered making a new version of it for Homestuck, but I always hesitated. I finally decided to go for it, since this was my last chance.

    P[S] is an album of Homestuck music and remixes from the official music team consisting of tracks that were cut from previous albums - most officially [[album:homestuck-vol-10|Vol. 10]], which was trimmed to 25 tracks because [[flash:4109|meme numbers]]. Get it here: Get P[S] here: [casualsunday.bandcamp.com/album/p-s](https://casualsunday.bandcamp.com/album/p-s)

    Here's my track, A Farewell to Arms, an ode to Homestuck music, and really a thank-you letter to the entire music team itself. I tried to quote something by every member of the team. Might've missed a couple people, but I tried my best. Frankly, without Homestuck music, I wouldn't be making music today. If you liked the music at all, I highly recommend tracking down what music team folks are doing nowadays - many of them could really use the support!

    (Also it's an arms joke.)
