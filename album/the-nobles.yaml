    From the depths of the Medium to the edge of the Furthest Ring, The Nobles tackles it all in a 14 track album based on the setting of the Alpha Session! (Also includes Commentary PDF and one whole bonus track by Pascal van den Bos)

    Hello whoever's reading this I'd like to personally thank you for taking the time to listen to my first solo endeavor The Nobles.
    
    So yeah this album has been something I've been dreaming of doing even way before I started writing music a year and a half ago and I'm so relived to have finally made it a reality. THis was one hell of an ambitious project so much that I had to push back the release date a few times due to self doubt and a lack in creativity.

    So starting this whole thing off we have the introductory song to the first half of the album. Side 1 was well the result of me being tired as hell at 4am trying to write a song. It was originally a lot longer with a really weird intro bit but was cut down once I decided to use it for Side 1. In the end I like how this turned out and I plan to finish the original version one day to make it a full song.
