    <b>Foreward</b>
    
    Hello whoever's reading this I'd like to personally thank you for taking the time to listen to my first solo endeavor The Nobles.
    
    So yeah this album has been something I've been dreaming of doing even way before I started writing music a year and a half ago and I'm so relived to have finally made it a reality. THis was one hell of an ambitious project so much that I had to push back the release date a few times due to self doubt and a lack in creativity. In the end it was completed... right? you're reading this right now aren't you? Yeah craziness aside this project is simply about the medium of the alpha kids and any and all aspects relating to it, so expect themes for the best set of lands out there and more! Now lets thank those who helped made this possible.

    First off I have to got to thank my main man [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Pascal]] for allowing me to do this and for originally accepting my pitch back in January. Also props to him for all the great feedback, a great job on the collab, and for being an amazing friend.

    Next we have [[artist:animmania|Animmania]], the amazing artist who had to put my with my bullshit while I went through my ups and downs. Without their art I don't think this album would've been good, most of the songs were directly inspired by the track art and it's all perfect. (They also put together these commentary pages that you're seeing now)

    Now I'd like to thank the members of [[group:the-paradox-music-team|the Paradox Music Team]] for all the support and feedback. In Particular [[artist:rainy]] and [[artist:beau-brian|Beau]] did great jobs on our collabs and also gave great feedback. [[artist:wumby|Wumby]] also helped me a lot when I was feeling low and finishing this album was something I promised her I'd do. Also shout out to [[artist:spad3s]] for mastering the whole album in such a short amount of time, I know I gave you help but thanks. Love you guys <3

    So starting this whole thing off we have the introductory song to the first half of the album. Side 1 was well the result of me being tired as hell at 4am trying to write a song. It was originally a lot longer with a really weird intro bit but was cut down once I decided to use it for Side 1. In the end I like how this turned out and I plan to finish the original version one day to make it a full song.

    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> [booklet commentary]

    So remember that shitty STLaP 2 song called [[track:miasmic-decay]]? Remember how I said that I'd like to revisit it one day? Well here we have what Decay was supposed to be. Resurrection was the first song I made back when The Nobles was still a concept and initially it was gonna be a simple Lo-Fi esque remix of Decay. So it was presumably finished until waaaaay later when most of the album was done and I said "hey I wanna make that better". I went back and drastically changed the b section to be more melodic so the song didn't feel lacking when compared to everything else. This was also when I was obsessed with that custom bass I made for [[track:those-who-tread-the-furthest-ring|Those Who Tread]] so it's in here lol. In the end I feel like I made a pretty decent LoTaK song even though it was my second shot at it. I hope this song represents my favorite character Dirk and his kick ass land more than my previous attempt. Enjoy!

    <i>Rowyn Berlan:</i> [booklet commentary]

    So this was originally made for the [[album:moons-of-theseus|MTaHK Tribute album]] that UMSPAF was doing until I pussied out for whatever reason which is why it references [[track:sburban-jungle|Sburban Jungle]]. Now with that idea scrapped I looked at the song again and was like "yeah I can make this into a LoCaH song" so I did... The End. Ok but seriously I repurposed what I liked about the original draft which was the vaguely Sburban Jungle lead and built everything around it. With help from [[artist:spad3s|Spad3s]] I made the song very open to capture a feel of endless exploration and I think it works well especially with the panned synth. THis is also where \#I first experimented with the Cave Story Plus soundfont which shows up pretty much everywhere in the album in some shape or form kinda like how the ChronoTrigger soundfont was all over my BeforusBound stuff. In the end I think this quaint little song fits Janes land well even though in retrospect its a bit simplistic.

    Pascal you beautiful lad... He helped me out so much with this song and I couldn't be happier with the end result.

    <i>Pascal van den Bos:</i> [booklet commentary]

    Uh yeah so Rowyn texted me at 3am asking if I wanted to help them on a song that they got stuck on for their solo album, clearly i dont sleep so i replied with a cheerful "HELL YEA".
    They sent me a pretty cool piano sketch that already had some of that signature "Timeless Sauce" on it, so I started having ideas for it pretty quickly. Prior to making this

    So we finally did it... we're at the end. To close out this passion project we have the reprise of the albums main theme. I decided that a somber take on [[track:the-nobles|the nobles]] would be a fitting end to our journey throughout the alpha session so I wrote just that. So lets keep this short... thanks so much for listening and giving my music a chance and for the last time I hope you enjoy!<br>
