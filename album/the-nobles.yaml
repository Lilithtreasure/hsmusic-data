    Hello whoever's reading this I'd like to personally thank you for taking the time to listen to my first solo endeavor The Nobles.
    
    So yeah this album has been something I've been dreaming of doing even way before I started writing music a year and a half ago and I'm so relived to have finally made it a reality. THis was one hell of an ambitious project so much that I had to push back the release date a few times due to self doubt and a lack in creativity. In the end it was completed... right? you're reading this right now aren't you? Yeah craziness aside this project is simply about the medium of the alpha kids and any and all aspects relating to it, so expect themes for the best set of lands out there and more! Now lets thank those who helped made this possible.

    First off I have to got to thank my main man [[artist:pascal-van-den-bos|Pascal]] for allowing me to do this and for originally accepting my pitch back in January. Also props to him for all the great feedback, a great job on the collab, and for being an amazing friend.

    Next we have [[artist:animmania|Animmania]], the amazing artist who had to put my with my bullshit while I went through my ups and downs. Without their art I don't think this album would've been good, most of the songs were directly inspired by the track art and it's all perfect. (They also put together these commentary pages that you're seeing now)

    Now I'd like to thank the members of [[group:the-paradox-music-team|the Paradox Music Team]] for all the support and feedback. In Particular [[artist:rainy]] and [[artist:beau-brian|Beau]] did great jobs on our collabs and also gave great feedback. [[artist:wumby|Wumby]] also helped me a lot when I was feeling low and finishing this album was something I promised her I'd do. Also shout out to [[artist:spad3s]] for mastering the whole album in such a short amount of time, I know I gave you help but thanks. Love you guys <3

    So starting this whole thing off we have the introductory song to the first half of the album. Side 1 was well the result of me being tired as hell at 4am trying to write a song. It was originally a lot longer with a really weird intro bit but was cut down once I decided to use it for Side 1. In the end I like how this turned out and I plan to finish the original version one day to make it a full song.

    So we finally did it... we're at the end. To close out this passion project we have the reprise of the albums main theme. I decided that a somber take on [[track:the-nobles|the nobles]] would be a fitting end to our journey throughout the alpha session so I wrote just that. So lets keep this short... thanks so much for listening and giving my music a chance and for the last time I hope you enjoy!
