    Basically a club dance theme for Fem!Gamzee. not sure how I arrived and settled on that idea, (probably from listening to \[[Tents and Mirth](https://web.archive.org/web/20100830182827/http://tindeck.com/listen/ebft)] too much), but thats what happened.

    Also, a shout out to [[artist:coffee-and-paperbags]] for drawing the picture and being ok with me using it as the art.

    This was the first track I ever made that was a decent success popularity-wise.

    This is pretty much a demo version, there's an effect that I'm gonna remove if I ever bother to release an EP since this will certainly be on it.

    Holy hell. 400 hits? Damn, now I wish I could upload the good version. This version has the accent percussion too loud and a nasty sounding effect that kills it in some places. But maybe that’s just me being anal. Glad so many people liked it! If I ever can justify buying a SC membership I’ll get the better version up for everyone.

    Note: Since people keep asking the reason this has so many hits is due to the fact that I posted it to tumblr and it got an assload of reblogs. There are also a couple people using it as their background music on youtube and I asked them to credit me in the description.
