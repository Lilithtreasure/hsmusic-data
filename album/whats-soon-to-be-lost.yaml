    OH I never posted this! It's a commission for @yuzusprout for their character Miyu and it continues to be one of my fave commissions I've done.  Had so much fun exploring synths and effects and pushed my skills a bunch with this one. Enjoy!

    It's not always I'm commissioned to make something 4 minutes long with >7 instruments, but this track for @yuzusprout's characters Miyu and Eden was a pleasure to work on and I'm excited about how it came out!
