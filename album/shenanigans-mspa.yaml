    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([Bandcamp download blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/))

    Comes complete with a near-perfect rendering of the [[flash:fan-animation-homestuck|"Irradiated"]] animation (in celebration of nearly 100,000 hits as of this writing), and a printable booklet of all original track art!

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/))

    Gracious thanks to the talented individuals running MS Paint Adventures, their hard work inspired me to write these recomposed works.

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([SoundCloud album description](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/sets/homestuck-mixes))

    Homestuck remixes, lots of them.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    This album is a rather early fandom release. Its entry on the wiki is mostly modeled around [the Bandcamp release](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/); this release is no longer directly available, but is rehosted [on skaia.net](http://dl.skaia.net/albums). Shenanigans: MSPA is also an [album/set on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/sets/homestuck-mixes) (by the composer), and this is still online.

    The track list on Bandcamp is the one reflected on the wiki, where tracks are alphabetical. On SoundCloud the tracks are ordered by chronological release, and a handful of tracks there were not on Bandcamp:

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([SoundCloud description](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/irradiated-updated), 6/20/2012)

    The original Irradiated remix, updated and given [[track:irradiated-lofam2|new life]] for [[album:lofam2|the homestuck fan music album 2]].

    <i>B. A. Baker:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/irradiated-updated), 6/23/2012)

    This was the first Homestuck fansong I ever found... literally one year ago, I discovered this song, loved it, and looked for more fanmusic until realizing how big the fanmusic community really was. Hearing this song again one year later is so cool.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    As the SoundCloud description and comment there indicate, this isn't the original version of Irradiated. It does appear to be the same version as included in [the Bandcamp release](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409111336/http://sparksd2145.bandcamp.com/) of Shenanigans: MSPA, with matching 2:16 duration and included in [the SoundCloud album/set](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/sets/homestuck-mixes).

    <i>Thomas Ibarra:</i> ([SoundCloud description](https://soundcloud.com/sparksd2145/rectify))

    Rectify, by AutoDevote. (now completed!)

    - I had an idea after I watched [[flash:4109|[S] Cascade]], and though I know it would go against Jack's present nature, I really feel like if he had the motivation to redirect his bloodthirsty warpath in the name of helping the kids (due to some unprecedented character development) he might. That being said, I sat down and began thinking. I've noticed a majority of the entries I've seen so far are covers of present songs, and while I was trying to stray away from using melodies and motifs that were already in existence, I decided to try my hand at it.

    I present my track for Jack Noir, Rectify. This is my second entry for the Homestuck Music Contest, and I really like the way this one turned out. I've logged twelve hours and nine minutes on this track so far, and I intend to polish it up just a bit further before I submit it officially. :D
