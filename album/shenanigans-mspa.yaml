    Rectify, by AutoDevote. (now completed!)

    - I had an idea after I watched [[flash:4109|[S] Cascade]], and though I know it would go against Jack's present nature, I really feel like if he had the motivation to redirect his bloodthirsty warpath in the name of helping the kids (due to some unprecedented character development) he might. That being said, I sat down and began thinking. I've noticed a majority of the entries I've seen so far are covers of present songs, and while I was trying to stray away from using melodies and motifs that were already in existence, I decided to try my hand at it.

    I present my track for Jack Noir, Rectify. This is my second entry for the Homestuck Music Contest, and I really like the way this one turned out. I've logged twelve hours and nine minutes on this track so far, and I intend to polish it up just a bit further before I submit it officially. :D
