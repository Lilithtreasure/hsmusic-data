    I started this with the idea of a Kurloz song in mind but i later realized i didnt need a kurloz song as much as i needed a Cal song, why was i making a Kurloz song? no idea! Either way i had only written the piano and some heartbeats when i decided to make this a song for Cal. I used a lot of samples from the game WarioWare D.I.Y since they all sound very wacky and sometimes eerie, perfect for cal lol. I also used the SOM chants that were used in versus to represent Cal's voice.

    (Maybe there's something we can do to make your stay a little more comfortable. Nice transistor radio for your cell maybe?)
    (No.)
    (How about a TV?)
    (Tell you what. I do like your blond friend here. Lemme see your belly button.)
    (Wh-no. What— let's go, come on.)
    (Noooo, nononono!) (No, listen— no, no! I'm not gonna—)
    (Oh, eureka!)

    This is another attempt at me trying a different genre than what i'm used to, i wanted to make a Lo-Fi beat for Dirk. I had a song in mind that he would maybe listen to while working on robots or something like that. I also sampled a bit from Starsky & Hutch at the beginning for obvious reasons that need no explanation. (Fun fact, the title of the song was a wip title for the album itself).

    So i was watching some old Pokemon movies and i got a bit inspired by the music in said old Pokemon movies, i wanted to make a part orchestral piece for the epic Brobot battle that takes place in [[flash:4572|[S] Prince of Heart: Rise Up.]] When i finished the song i posted it in the Music channel to see if anyone had feedback, when i checked back [[artist:funk-mclovin|JoJo]] had offered to play live trumpet since the horns i used were pretty trashy, so obviously i took that and now the song sounds amazing.

    Hey another attempt at a genre i'm unfamiliar with, i wanted to make a Synthwave track to fit with the theme of 2001: A Space Odyssey references like the title and the art for Hal. After this i actually made a full synthwave album because i liked the genre so much.

    Dave already produced music before he became Davepetasprite^2 or even Davesprite, so with this song i tried to make something that Davepetasprite^2 would make. A song with influences from Dave and Nepeta, that means lots of MarioPaint but PHAT MarioPaint.

    This song is heavily based off [[track:versus]], i wanted to make a more happy song based on Versus to play when Dave is battling alongside Dirk to show that he's happier after all the stuff that happened with Bro. Kind of like a post scratch version of Versus as [[artist:caelan-kier]] puts it, lol.
